Assignment 7 Log

I created the Map class and most of its functions and data members and used the DungeonBoard program as a base for the map generation code. I also created the Main.cpp file and its functions.  I made the Main.cpp menu system function for setting the size of the map and for moving the player on the map, and the get functions to check how many monsters and items there are in order to win the game. In the Map class, I modified the “setupMobs” and “setupItems” functions and made the “setupPlayer” function for allocating objects on the map. I made the majority of the “move” function for getting commands from Main.cpp and changing and displaying the players position on the map, and worked on the collision code which my group partners helped with.

I created the Player class and its functions and data members. In Player.cpp, I did the combat functions, including all of the combat menu options, the combat menu function itself, the attacks (random, physical, and special) that the player and the wild monster would use against each other, and the functions involving choosing a monster from the player’s dynamic list of monsters. I implemented the CatchMonster() function and the percentages inside of it and managed the dynamic list (monsterList) of monsters that the player had. In that, I handled the AddMonster() and RemoveMonster() functions. I also worked on the potions and coins count in the Player.cpp file, and handled the AddPotion(), UsePotion(), and AddCoin() functions. My group partners and I also made some fixes to each others’ files to make sure they worked okay together.

I created the Monster class and its functions and data members with a few adjustments from Tatiana to make sure it compiled with the Player class. I implemented the wildMonster array to hold the array of Monsters when they’re created. The monster class holds the coordinates of each monster so that they can be compared to the spot on the board the player is at. Therefore if a player were to run from the fight, they’d still be fighting the same monster if they tried the monster in that spot again. I implemented the checks in the set up of mobs and items to make sure they don’t spawn on top of each other. I made simple edits to main.cpp and map.cpp including adding comments with explanations and reorganizing the code to be more readable. I also added the RemoveMonster() function to the map class.
